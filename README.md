# Kickstarting with Excel
Module 1 Challenge

## Overview of Project
This project uses Excel to analyze data about various Kickstarter campaigns.
Louise, the client, is creating a campaign to fund her play. The project focuses
on Kickstarter campaigns in the theater sector in order to provide the most
relevant and useful information.

### Purpose
The project seeks to determine the optimal goal amount and launch date for
Louise's campaign to achieve success.

## Analysis and Challenges
In this section of the report, we will organize and review data regarding
outcomes based on two factors: launch date and goals. We will also review the
limitations of the data set and challenges in the analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After organizing the data based on the theater category, we created a pivot
chart to show the outcomes of campaigns based on the launch dates. As you can
see in the below image, the most successful month for launching a campaign is
May. Based on the data, the least successful month for launching a campaign is
December. We recommend launching a campaign in May for the highest chance of
success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaign goals are a very important aspect of Kickstarter campaigns. Choosing
a goal that will increase your chances of a successful campaign is as
important as choosing a goal that will cover your costs. Using the data, we
created the chart included below. This chart suggests that keeping the goal
under $5000 is your best chance of success. 73% of campaigns in to $1000-$4999
range had successful outcomes. The success rate drops to 55% in the next range
of $5000-$9999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When analyzing outcomes by goals, the percentage of successful campaigns
increases again in the $35000-$39999 range and the $40000-$44999 range. This is
an anomaly that would require more information to explain. For example, more
information about how the campaigns were marketed would be helpful. It would
also be helpful to know if these successful campaigns with higher goals had
multiple backers who gave large donations.

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There are two main takeaways when looking at outcomes based on launch date.
First, the best month to start a campaign is May. Second, the worst month to
start a campaign is December.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Two conclusions that can be drawn when looking at outcomes based on goals are
that keeping your campaign goal under $5000 increases success, and that chances
of success drop dramatically when campaign goals are $25000 or more.

### Limitations of the Dataset
Although we are able to glean a lot of information from this dataset, there are
certainly limitations. We can determine the average donation based on the amount
pledged and the number of backers, but we cannot determine individual donations.
We also cannot see any information about where links to each campaign were
shared. It would be helpful to know, for example, if it is better to advertise
your campaign on Instagram, Facebook, or other social media platforms. It would
also be helpful to know the number of times a campaign was shared, and how.

### Additional Tables/Graphs
It would be useful to create a chart which compares both the launch date and
the campaign goal. It would be useful to know, for example, if a campaign
launched in May has a higher chance of success regardless of the campaign goal,
or if certain goal ranges are still more successful.
